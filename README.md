In IK mode: you can set IK by set fixed controller, and then move the controller, and you can set reverse FK by fixed two ends controller and select the controller you want to rotate, the front fixed controller will be pivot.

In Fix mode: you can't select the controller inside the fix controller chain, here is a place you can rotate in IK mode or move in FK mode

In Lock mode: you can't select any controller, in here you can see the animation you set and edit it use those things like Graph Editor, and you can adjust pole position by select the pole in IK mode and then entry Lock mode

Custom controller: select the controller you set you self, and click the install controller on the panel, then this tool will leave it along and will not install any controller over it, and make some deform bone's controller vanish is same thing
